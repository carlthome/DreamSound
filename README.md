# Text-to-Music Personalization
#### Code for _Investigating Personalization Methods in Text to Music Generation Generation_

Recently, text-to-music generation models have achieved unprecedented results in synthesizing high-quality and diverse music samples from a given text prompt. Despite these advances, it remains unclear how one can generate personalized, user-specific musical concepts, manipulate them, and combine them with existing ones. For example, can one generate a rock song using their personal guitar playing style or a specific ethnic instrument? Motivated by the computer vision literature, we investigate text-to-music \textit{personalization} by exploring two established methods, namely Textual Inversion and Dreambooth. Using quantitative metrics and a user study, we evaluate their ability to reconstruct and modify new musical concepts, given only a few samples. Finally, we provide a new dataset and propose an evaluation protocol for this new task.
